This is an extraction and cleaning of data taken from a free-to-use police API. The API had no endpoint and therefore after a large amount of 
testing and trying I decided to download the data instead and use it locally.

Included in this folder is a Jupyter file that involves code and comments working to clean, combine and export locally stored police data that
has been downloaded from the https://data.police.uk/data/ API site.

The output is in the form of two SQLite databases, and two CSV files. Each CSV file mirrors a respective SQLite table, one representing all the
crime data stored in the parent folder that has an associated outcome, another that counts the number of crimes that do not have outcomes, with
respect to the station responsible.

Unfortunately the file for the main crime table is too large to store in github without using the lsf extension. As such I have included my source
code, which produces the following tables, along with the first 100 rows of the main crime CSV file, and the whole station outcome table CSV file.
