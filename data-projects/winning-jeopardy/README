This is a project I undertook for fun to test how I would theoretically win the game show Jeopardy. I used a large dataset of almost 20000 questions and 
answers to answer questions like, can you guess answers based on questions, what topics are used regularly in the more valuable questions, and how commonly
do they reuse questions. I'd like to work on this more and fill it out.
