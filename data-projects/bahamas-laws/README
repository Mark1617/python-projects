This was a task I undertook as part of a job application, but was curious and hence continued to learn about the framework Scrapy.
In it I use Scrapy to web scrape all the pdf files from the Bahamas government website to create a JSON containing the relevant information.
I have only included the spider and the output into this directory as the entire virtual project environment will be too much.
